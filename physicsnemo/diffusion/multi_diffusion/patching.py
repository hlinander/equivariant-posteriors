    Reconstructs a full image from a batch of patched images. Reverts the patching
    operation performed by :func:`~physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.image_batching`.

    It assumes that the patches are extracted in a grid-like pattern, and that
    their layout along the batch dimension is the same as the one returned by
    :func:`~physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.image_batching`.

    This function takes a batch of image patches and reconstructs the full
    image by stitching the patches together. The function accounts for
    overlapping and boundary pixels, ensuring that overlapping areas are
    averaged.
    *Note: a simple unweighted average between overlapping patches is used to
    fuse the patches.*

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : Tensor
        The input tensor containing the image patches with shape :math:`(P \times B, C, H_p, W_p)`.
    img_shape_y : int
        The height :math:`H` of the original full image.
    img_shape_x : int
        The width :math:`W` of the original full image.
    batch_size : int
        The original batch size :math:`B` before patching.
    overlap_pix : int
        The number of overlapping pixels between adjacent patches.
    boundary_pix : int
        The number of pixels to crop as a boundary from each patch.
    overlap_count : Tensor, optional, default=None
        A tensor of shape :math:`(1, 1, H, W)` containing the number of
        overlaps for each pixel (i.e. the number of patches that cover each pixel).
        This is typically computed by
        :meth:`~physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.GridPatching2D.get_overlap_count`.
        If not provided, it will be computed internally.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The reconstructed full image tensor with shape :math:`(B, C, H, W)`.
