class Mesh:
    r"""A PyTorch-based, dimensionally-generic Mesh data structure.

    A ``Mesh`` is a discrete representation of an n-dimensional manifold embedded
    in m-dimensional Euclidean space (where n ≤ m). Field data can be associated
    with each point, with each cell, or globally with the mesh itself. This field
    data can be arbitrarily-dimensional (scalar fields, vector fields, or
    arbitrary-rank tensor fields) and semantically-rich (supporting string keys
    and nested data structures).

    **Simplices**

    The building block of a ``Mesh`` is a **simplex** (plural: **simplices**): a
    generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary
    dimensions. Consider these familiar examples of an n-dimensional simplex
    (an **n-simplex**):

    =========  ====================  =========================================
               Common Name           Description
    =========  ====================  =========================================
    0-simplex  Point                 A single vertex
    1-simplex  Line Segment / Edge   Connects 2 points; boundary: 2 0-simplices
    2-simplex  Triangle              Connects 3 points; boundary: 3 1-simplices
    3-simplex  Tetrahedron           Connects 4 points; boundary: 4 2-simplices
    =========  ====================  =========================================

    **Manifold Dimension**

    A ``Mesh`` is a collection of simplices that share vertices. Every simplex
    in a ``Mesh`` must have the same dimension; this shared dimension is called
    the **manifold dimension** (``n_manifold_dims``), representing the intrinsic
    dimensionality of each cell. A triangle has manifold dimension 2 regardless
    of whether it lives in 2D or 3D space.

    **Spatial Dimension and Codimension**

    The **spatial dimension** (``n_spatial_dims``) is the dimension of the
    embedding space where point coordinates live. A triangle mesh representing
    a 3D surface has ``n_spatial_dims=3`` but ``n_manifold_dims=2``.

    The difference, **codimension** = ``n_spatial_dims - n_manifold_dims``,
    determines whether unique normal vectors exist:

    - Codimension 1 (triangles in 3D, edges in 2D): unique unit normal (up to sign)
    - Codimension 0 (triangles in 2D, tets in 3D): no normal direction exists
    - Codimension > 1 (edges in 3D): infinitely many normal directions

    **Core Data Structure**

    A mesh is defined by two tensors:

    - ``points``: Vertex coordinates with shape :math:`(N_p, D_s)` where
      :math:`N_p` is the number of points and :math:`D_s` is the spatial
      dimension. For 1000 vertices in 3D: shape ``(1000, 3)``.

    - ``cells``: Cell connectivity with shape :math:`(N_c, D_m + 1)` where
      :math:`N_c` is the number of cells and :math:`D_m` is the manifold
      dimension. Each row lists point indices defining one simplex. For 500
      triangles: shape ``(500, 3)`` since each triangle references 3 vertices.

    **Attaching Field Data**

    Tensor data of any shape can be attached at three levels:

    - ``point_data``: Per-vertex quantities (temperature, velocity, embeddings)
    - ``cell_data``: Per-cell quantities (pressure, stress, material ID)
    - ``global_data``: Mesh-level quantities (simulation time, Reynolds number)

    All data is stored in ``TensorDict`` containers that move together with the
    mesh geometry under ``.to(device)`` calls.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : torch.Tensor
        Vertex coordinates with shape :math:`(N_p, D_s)`. Must be floating-point.
    cells : torch.Tensor
        Cell connectivity with shape :math:`(N_c, D_m + 1)`. Each row contains
        indices into ``points`` defining one simplex. Must be integer dtype.
    point_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Per-vertex data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.
    cell_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Per-cell data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.
    global_data : TensorDict or dict[str, torch.Tensor], optional
        Mesh-level data. Dicts are automatically converted to TensorDict.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``points`` is not 2D, ``cells`` is not 2D, or manifold dimension
        exceeds spatial dimension.
    TypeError
        If ``cells`` has a floating-point dtype (indices must be integers).

    Examples
    --------
    Create a 2D triangular mesh (two triangles forming a unit square):

    >>> import torch
    >>> from physicsnemo.mesh import Mesh
    >>> points = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0.0, 0.0],  # vertex 0: bottom-left
    ...     [1.0, 0.0],  # vertex 1: bottom-right
    ...     [1.0, 1.0],  # vertex 2: top-right
    ...     [0.0, 1.0],  # vertex 3: top-left
    ... ])
    >>> cells = torch.tensor([
    ...     [0, 1, 2],  # triangle 0: vertices 0-1-2
    ...     [0, 2, 3],  # triangle 1: vertices 0-2-3
    ... ])
    >>> mesh = Mesh(points=points, cells=cells)
    >>> mesh.n_points, mesh.n_cells, mesh.n_spatial_dims, mesh.n_manifold_dims
    (4, 2, 2, 2)

    Attach field data at vertices and cells:

    >>> mesh = Mesh(
    ...     points=points,
    ...     cells=cells,
    ...     point_data={"temperature": torch.tensor([300., 350., 340., 310.])},
    ...     cell_data={"pressure": torch.tensor([101.3, 99.8])},
    ... )

    Move mesh and all data to GPU:

    >>> mesh_gpu = mesh.to("cuda")  # doctest: +SKIP

    Create an undirected graph (1-simplices in 3D):

    >>> nodes = torch.randn(100, 3)  # 100 vertices in 3D
    >>> edges = torch.randint(0, 100, (200, 2))  # 200 edges
    >>> graph = Mesh(points=nodes, cells=edges)
    >>> graph.n_manifold_dims, graph.n_spatial_dims
    (1, 3)

    Notes
    -----
    **Mixed Manifold Dimensions**

    To represent structures with multiple manifold dimensions (e.g., a
    tetrahedral volume mesh together with its triangular boundary surface),
    use separate ``Mesh`` objects for each dimension.

    **Non-Simplicial Elements**

    This class only supports simplicial cells. Non-simplicial elements must be
    subdivided before use:

    - **Quads** → split into 2 triangles each
    - **Hexahedra** → split into 5 or 6 tetrahedra each
    - **Polygons/polyhedra** → triangulate/tetrahedralize

    **Caching**

    Expensive geometric computations (centroids, areas, normals, etc.) are
    cached in the ``_cache`` field - a nested TensorDict with ``"cell"`` and
    ``"point"`` sub-TensorDicts. Access cached values via nested keys::

        mesh._cache["cell", "centroids"]   # shape (n_cells, n_dims)
        mesh._cache["point", "normals"]    # shape (n_points, n_dims)

    The cache is separate from ``cell_data`` / ``point_data``, so user data
    is never mixed with internal cached geometry. To clear all caches,
    construct a new Mesh without passing ``_cache`` (it defaults to empty).

        For each point (vertex), computes a normal vector by averaging the normals
        of all adjacent cells. This provides a smooth approximation of the surface
        normal at each vertex.

        Four weighting schemes are available (following industry conventions from
        Autodesk Maya and 3ds Max):

        - **"area"**: Area-weighted averaging, where larger faces have more
          influence on the vertex normal. The normal at vertex v is computed as:
          ``point_normal_v = normalize(sum(cell_normal * cell_area))``.
          This reduces the influence of small sliver triangles.

        - **"unweighted"**: Simple averaging, where each adjacent face contributes
          equally regardless of size. The normal at vertex v is:
          ``point_normal_v = normalize(sum(cell_normal))``.
          This matches PyVista/VTK's ``compute_normals`` behavior.

        - **"angle"**: Angle-weighted averaging, where faces are weighted by the
          interior angle at the vertex. Faces with larger angles at the vertex
          have more influence. This often provides the most geometrically accurate
          normals for curved surfaces.

        - **"angle_area"** (default): Combined angle and area weighting, where each face's
          contribution is weighted by both its area and the angle at the vertex.
          This is the default in Maya and balances both geometric factors.

        Normal vectors are only well-defined for codimension-1 manifolds, where each
        cell has a unique normal direction. For higher codimensions, normals are
        ambiguous and this method will raise an error.

        Parameters
        ----------
        weighting : {"area", "unweighted", "angle", "angle_area"}
            Weighting scheme for averaging adjacent cell normals.
            - "area": Weight by cell area (larger faces have more influence).
            - "unweighted": Equal weight for all adjacent cells (matches PyVista/VTK).
            - "angle": Weight by interior angle at the vertex.
            - "angle_area": Weight by both angle and area (Maya default).

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            Tensor of shape (n_points, n_spatial_dims) containing unit normal vectors

        Parameters
        ----------
        cell_indices : Sequence[int] or torch.Tensor or None, optional

            Shape: (n_samples,) where n_samples is the number of points to sample.
        alpha : float, optional
            Concentration parameter for the Dirichlet distribution. Controls how
            samples are distributed within each cell:
            - alpha = 1.0: Uniform distribution over the simplex (default)

              Currently only supports 2D manifolds (triangular meshes).
              Preserves original vertices.

            - Point data is interpolated to new vertices
            - Cell data is propagated from parents to children

        -----
        Multi-level subdivision is achieved by iterative application.
        For levels=3, this is equivalent to calling subdivide(levels=1)
        three times in sequence. This is the standard approach for all
        subdivision schemes.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from physicsnemo.mesh.primitives.basic import two_triangles_2d
        >>> # Linear subdivision of triangular mesh
        >>> mesh = two_triangles_2d.load()
        >>> refined = mesh.subdivide(levels=2, filter="linear")
        >>> # Each triangle splits into 4, twice: 2 -> 8 -> 32 triangles
        >>> assert refined.n_cells == mesh.n_cells * 16

        Performs various cleaning operations to fix common mesh issues:
        1. Merge duplicate points within tolerance
        2. Remove duplicate cells
        3. Remove unused points

        This is useful after mesh operations that may introduce duplicate geometry
        or after importing meshes from external sources that may have redundant data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tolerance : float, optional
            Absolute L2 distance threshold for merging duplicate points.
        merge_points : bool, optional
            Whether to merge duplicate points (default True).
        remove_duplicate_cells : bool, optional
            Whether to remove duplicate cells (default True).
        remove_unused_points : bool, optional

        This method creates a new mesh without these cached values, which is useful

        - Accurate benchmarking (prevents false performance benefits from caching)
