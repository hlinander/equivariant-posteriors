    This redistributes the local tensor (``torch.Tensor``) from the current
    ShardTensorSpec to the target ShardTensorSpec, which involves the necessary
    collective calls to transform the local shard of the ShardTensor from its
    current spec to the target spec.

    The collective operations are implemented in the Placement classes, which
    we avoid modifying. To get around that, we mimic the logic from PyTorch's
    original redistribute. But in cases where a tensor is sharded and the
    shards are uneven, we intercept and replace the collectives:

    - ``Shard(dim)`` -> ``Replicate()``: ``all_gather_v`` instead of ``all_gather``
    - ``Shard(src_dim)`` -> ``Shard(dst_dim)``: remains all_to_all but
      reimplemented to handle sizes correctly
    - ``Replicate()`` -> ``Shard(dim)``: local chunking is unchanged but return
      value is ShardTensorSpec instead
    - ``Partial()`` -> ``Replicate()``: ``all_reduce`` needs to become a weighted
      ``all_reduce``, depending on operation
    - ``Partial()`` -> ``Shard(dim)``: ``reduce_scatter`` needs to become a
      weighted ``reduce_scatter``, depending on operation

    Parameters
    ----------

    current_spec : ShardTensorSpec
        Specification of current sharding scheme.

    async_op : bool, default=False
