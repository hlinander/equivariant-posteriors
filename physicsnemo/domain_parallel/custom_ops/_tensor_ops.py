r"""Custom tensor operations for ShardTensor dispatch.

This module provides propagation rules for tensor operations that need
special handling when applied to ``ShardTensor`` objects. These rules
are registered with PyTorch's DTensor operation dispatch system.

    r"""Propagation rule for ``torch.unbind`` on ShardTensor.

    Computes the output sharding specification when unbinding a sharded tensor
    along a specified dimension. The unbind operation removes one dimension
    from the tensor and returns a tuple of tensors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    op_schema : OpSchema
        The operation schema containing input specifications and arguments.
        Expected to contain:

        - ``args_schema[0]``: Input tensor specification (DTensorSpec)
        - ``args_schema[1]``: Dimension to unbind along (int), defaults to 0

    Returns
    -------
    OutputSharding
        Output sharding specification containing a list of DTensorSpec objects,
        one for each tensor in the unbind result.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If attempting to unbind along a sharded dimension (not yet implemented).
        If attempting to unbind with Partial placement (not yet supported).

    Note
    ----
    This rule is needed for operations like attention in Stormcast and other
    models that unbind tensors along non-sharded dimensions.
