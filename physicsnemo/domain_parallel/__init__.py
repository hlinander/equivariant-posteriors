r"""Domain parallel utilities for distributed tensor operations.

This module provides the ``ShardTensor`` class and related utilities for
domain-parallel computation across multiple devices. Unlike PyTorch's native
``DTensor``, ``ShardTensor`` supports uneven sharding where different ranks
can have different local tensor sizes.

Key components:

- ``ShardTensor``: A distributed tensor class supporting uneven sharding
- ``ShardTensorSpec``: Specification class tracking sharding metadata
- ``scatter_tensor``: Utility to distribute tensors from a source rank

Note
----
This module requires PyTorch >= 2.6.0. Earlier versions are not supported.
