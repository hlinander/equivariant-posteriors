    r"""Ring-based kNN implementation where points travel around a ring and queries stay local.

    This function performs k-nearest neighbor search using a distributed ring-based
    algorithm. The points are passed around different devices in a ring topology while
    the queries remain local to each device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : ShardTensor
        The point cloud data tensor that will be distributed around the ring.
        Must be sharded on the same mesh as queries.
    queries : ShardTensor
        The query points tensor that stays local on each device.
        Must be sharded on the same mesh as points.
    k : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to find for each query point.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
        A tuple containing:

        - ``shard_idx`` : Indices of the k nearest neighbors for each query point
