r"""Sharded view and reshape operations for :class:`ShardTensor`.

This module provides a proper implementation of ``view`` / ``reshape`` for
:class:`ShardTensor`, replacing the inline contiguity hack that previously
lived in :meth:`ShardTensor.__torch_dispatch__`.

Supported overloads:

- **view(*shape)** / **reshape(*shape)** — change shape; shard dimensions
  flow through dimension-group matching.
- **view(dtype)** — reinterpret storage as another dtype (e.g. ``.view(torch.float32)``).
  Same shape when dtypes have the same ``itemsize``, otherwise 1D; matches PyTorch.

The core challenge for shape-changing view/reshape is that they change the
tensor's dimensionality, so we must track how sharded dimensions flow through
the dimension-group matching to compute:

1. The **local target shape** (global target shape with shard dims adjusted).
2. The **new placements** (shard dim index may change after merge/split).
3. The **new sharding shapes** (per-rank local shapes in the new layout).

All of the above are computed locally — no collective communication is required.

Handlers are registered at both the ``__torch_function__`` level (for
``torch.Tensor.view``, ``torch.Tensor.reshape``, ``torch.reshape``, and
``aten.view.default``) and the ``__torch_dispatch__`` level (for
``aten.view.default``).
