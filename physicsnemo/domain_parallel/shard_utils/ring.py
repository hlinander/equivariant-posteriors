r"""Ring communication utilities for distributed tensor operations.

This module provides utilities for ring-based collective communication patterns.
Ring communication is useful for operations where data needs to be passed around
in a circular fashion between processes, such as ring attention.

The module provides:

- ``RingPassingConfig``: Configuration dataclass for ring communication parameters
- ``perform_ring_iteration``: Function to perform a single step of ring communication

    r"""Configuration for ring-based communication operations.

    This class encapsulates all parameters needed for ring communication patterns,
    making it easier to pass consistent configurations between functions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    mesh_dim : int
        Mesh dimension for the ring communication.
    mesh_size : int
        Size of the mesh for this communication.
    ring_direction : Literal["forward", "backward"]
        Direction of ring communication. ``"forward"`` sends to rank+1,
        ``"backward"`` sends to rank-1. Default is ``"forward"``.
    communication_method : Literal["p2p", "a2a"]
        Method for exchanging data. ``"p2p"`` uses point-to-point operations,
        ``"a2a"`` uses all-to-all. Default is ``"a2a"``.

    r"""Perform a single step of ring collective communication.

    Tensors are sent to the next rank in the ring, and wrap around from rank N-1
    to rank 0. This implements a single step of ring communication where each
    process sends data to its neighbor and receives data from its other neighbor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor : torch.Tensor
        The tensor to be sent in this ring communication step.
    mesh : DeviceMesh
        Device mesh that defines the distributed process group.
    ring_config : RingPassingConfig
        Configuration for the ring communication pattern.
    recv_shape : Union[torch.Size, None], optional
        Shape of the tensor to receive. If ``None``, assumes same shape as
        the tensor being sent.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The tensor received from the previous rank in the ring.
