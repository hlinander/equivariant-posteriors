class KNN(FunctionSpec):
    """
    Perform a k-nearest neighbor search on torch tensors.  Can be done with
    torch directly, or leverage RAPIDS cuML algorithm.

    Auto-dispatch selects the optimal version for the input tensor device.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape (N, 3) containing the points to search from.
    queries : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape (M, 3) containing the points to search for.
    k : int
        Number of nearest neighbors to return for each query point.
    implementation : {"cuml", "torch", "scipy"} or None
        Implementation to use for the search. When ``None``, the preferred
        implementation for the input device is selected and falls back to
        torch when unavailable.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape (M, k) containing the indices of the k nearest
        neighbors for each query point.
    distances : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of shape (M, k) containing the distances to the k nearest
        neighbors for each query point.
