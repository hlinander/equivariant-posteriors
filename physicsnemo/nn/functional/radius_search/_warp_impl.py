This file contains the interface between PyTorch and Warp kernels.

It uses a mix of utilities, such that it needs to be opaque to pure PyTorch.
At the same time, we want to rely on PyTorch's memory allocation as much as possible
and not warp.  So, tensor creation and allocation is driven by torch, and
passed to warp for computation.
