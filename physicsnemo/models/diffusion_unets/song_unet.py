class SongUNet(Module):
    r"""
    This architecture is a diffusion backbone for 2D image generation.
    It is a reimplementation of the `DDPM++
    <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/nichol21a.html>`_ and `NCSN++ <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456>`_
    architectures, which are U-Net variants
    with optional self-attention, embeddings, and encoder-decoder components.

    This model supports conditional and unconditional setups, as well as several
    options for various internal architectural choices such as encoder and decoder
    type, embedding type, etc., making it flexible and adaptable to different tasks
    and configurations.

    This architecture supports conditioning on the noise level (called *noise labels*),
    as well as on additional vector-valued labels (called *class labels*) and (optional)
    vector-valued augmentation labels. The conditioning mechanism relies on addition
    of the conditioning embeddings in the U-Net blocks of the encoder. To condition
    on images, the simplest mechanism is to concatenate the image to the input
    before passing it to the SongUNet.

    The model first applies a mapping operation to generate embeddings for all
    the conditioning inputs (the noise level, the class labels, and the
    optional augmentation labels).

    Then, at each level in the U-Net encoder, a sequence of blocks is applied:

    • A first block downsamples the feature map resolution by a factor of 2
      (odd resolutions are floored). This block does not change the number of
      channels.

    • A sequence of ``num_blocks`` U-Net blocks are applied, each with a different
      number of channels. These blocks do not change the feature map
      resolution, but they multiply the number of channels by a factor
      specified in ``channel_mult``.
      If required, the U-Net blocks also apply self-attention at the specified
      resolutions.

    • At the end of the level, the feature map is cached to be used in a skip
      connection in the decoder.

    The decoder is a mirror of the encoder, with the same number of levels and
    the same number of blocks per level. It multiplies the feature map resolution
    by a factor of 2 at each level.

    Parameters
    -----------
    img_resolution : Union[List[int, int], int]
        The resolution of the input/output image. Can be a single int :math:`H` for
        square images or a list :math:`[H, W]` for rectangular images.

        *Note:* This parameter is only used as a convenience to build the
        network. In practice, the model can still be used with images of
        different resolutions. The only exception to this rule is when
        ``additive_pos_embed`` is True, in which case the resolution of the latent
        state :math:`\mathbf{x}` must match ``img_resolution``.
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels :math:`C_{in}` in the input image. May include channels from both
        the latent state and additional channels when conditioning on images.
        For an unconditional model, this should be equal to ``out_channels``.
    out_channels : int
        Number of channels :math:`C_{out}` in the output image. Should be equal to the number
        of channels :math:`C_{\mathbf{x}}` in the latent state.
    label_dim : int, optional, default=0
        Dimension of the vector-valued ``class_labels`` conditioning; 0
        indicates no conditioning on class labels.
    augment_dim : int, optional, default=0
        Dimension of the vector-valued `augment_labels` conditioning; 0 means
        no conditioning on augmentation labels.
    model_channels : int, optional, default=128
        Base multiplier for the number of channels accross the entire network.
    channel_mult : List[int], optional, default=[1, 2, 2, 2]
        Multipliers for the number of channels at every level in
        the encoder and decoder. The length of ``channel_mult`` determines the
        number of levels in the U-Net. At level ``i``, the number of channel in
        the feature map is ``channel_mult[i] * model_channels``.
    channel_mult_emb : int, optional, default=4
        Multiplier for the number of channels in the embedding vector. The
        embedding vector has ``model_channels * channel_mult_emb`` channels.
    num_blocks : int, optional, default=4
        Number of U-Net blocks at each level.
    attn_resolutions : List[int], optional, default=[16]
        Resolutions of the levels at which self-attention layers are applied.
        Note that the feature map resolution must match exactly the value
        provided in `attn_resolutions` for the self-attention layers to be
        applied.
    dropout : float, optional, default=0.10
        Dropout probability applied to intermediate activations within the
        U-Net blocks.
    label_dropout : float, optional, default=0.0
        Dropout probability applied to the `class_labels`. Typically used for
        classifier-free guidance.
    embedding_type : Literal["fourier", "positional", "zero"], optional, default="positional"
        Diffusion timestep embedding type: 'positional' for DDPM++, 'fourier'
        for NCSN++, 'zero' for none.
    channel_mult_noise : int, optional, default=1
        Multiplier for the number of channels in the noise level embedding. The
        noise level embedding vector has ``model_channels * channel_mult_noise`` channels.
    encoder_type : Literal["standard", "skip", "residual"], optional, default="standard"
        Encoder architecture: 'standard' for DDPM++, 'residual' for NCSN++, 'skip' for skip connections.
    decoder_type : Literal["standard", "skip"], optional, default="standard"
        Decoder architecture: 'standard' or 'skip' for skip connections.
    resample_filter : List[int], optional, default=[1, 1]
        Resampling filter coefficients applied in the U-Net blocks
        convolutions: [1,1] for DDPM++, [1,3,3,1] for NCSN++.
    checkpoint_level : int, optional, default=0
        Number of levels that should use gradient checkpointing. Only levels at
        which the feature map resolution is large enough will be checkpointed
        (0 disables checkpointing, higher values means more layers are checkpointed).
        Higher values trade memory for computation.
    additive_pos_embed : bool, optional, default=False
        If ``True``, adds a learnable positional embedding after the first convolution layer.
        Used in StormCast model.

        *Note:* Those positional embeddings encode spatial position information
        of the image pixels, unlike the ``embedding_type`` parameter which encodes
        temporal information about the diffusion process. In that sense it is a
        simpler version of the positional embedding used in
        :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNetPosEmbd`.
    bottleneck_attention : bool, optional, default=True
        If ``True``, applies self-attention at the bottleneck (innermost decoder block).
        Set to ``False`` to disable bottleneck attention for faster inference.
    use_apex_gn : bool, optional, default=False
        A flag indicating whether we want to use Apex GroupNorm for NHWC layout.
        Apex needs to be installed for this to work. Need to set this as False on cpu.
    act : str, optional, default=None
        The activation function to use when fusing activation with GroupNorm.
        Required when ``use_apex_gn`` is ``True``.
    profile_mode : bool, optional, default=False
        A flag indicating whether to enable all nvtx annotations during
        profiling.
    amp_mode : bool, optional, default=False
        A flag indicating whether mixed-precision (AMP) training is enabled.


    Forward
    -------
    x : torch.Tensor
        The input image of shape :math:`(B, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`. In
        general ``x`` is the channel-wise concatenation of the latent state
        :math:`\mathbf{x}` and additional images used for conditioning. For an
        unconditional model, ``x`` is simply the latent state
        :math:`\mathbf{x}`.

        *Note:* :math:`H_{in}` and :math:`W_{in}` do not need to match
        :math:`H` and :math:`W` defined in ``img_resolution``, except when
        ``additive_pos_embed`` is ``True``. In that case, the resolution of
        ``x`` must match ``img_resolution``.
    noise_labels : torch.Tensor
        The noise labels of shape :math:`(B,)`. Used for conditioning on
        the diffusion noise level.
    class_labels : torch.Tensor
        The class labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{label_dim})`. Used for
        conditioning on any vector-valued quantity. Can pass ``None`` when
        ``label_dim`` is 0.
    augment_labels : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The augmentation labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{augment_dim})`. Used
        for conditioning on any additional vector-valued quantity. Can pass
        ``None`` when ``augment_dim`` is 0.

    Outputs
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The denoised latent state of shape :math:`(B, C_{out}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.


    .. important::
        • The terms *noise levels* (or *noise labels*) are used to refer to the diffusion time-step, as these are conceptually equivalent.
        • The terms *labels* and *classes* originate from the original paper and EDM repository,
          where this architecture was used for class-conditional image generation. While these terms
          suggest class-based conditioning, the architecture can actually be conditioned on any vector-valued
          conditioning.
        • The term *positional embedding* used in the `embedding_type` parameter
          also comes from the original paper and EDM repository. Here,
          *positional* refers to the diffusion time-step, similar to how position is used in transformer
          architectures. Despite the name, these embeddings encode temporal information about the
          diffusion process rather than spatial position information.
        • Limitations on input image resolution: for a model that has :math:`N` levels,
          the latent state :math:`\mathbf{x}` must have resolution that is a multiple of :math:`2^{N-1}` in each dimension.
          This is due to a limitation in the decoder that does not support shape mismatch
          in the residual connections from the encoder to the decoder. For images that do not match
          this requirement, it is recommended to interpolate your data on a grid of the required resolution
          beforehand.

    Example
    --------
    >>> model = SongUNet(img_resolution=16, in_channels=2, out_channels=2)
    >>> noise_labels = torch.randn([1])
    >>> class_labels = torch.randint(0, 1, (1, 1))
    >>> input_image = torch.ones([1, 2, 16, 16])
    >>> output_image = model(input_image, noise_labels, class_labels)
    >>> output_image.shape
    torch.Size([1, 2, 16, 16])

class SongUNetPosEmbd(SongUNet):
    r"""This specialized architecture extends
    :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet` with positional
    embeddings that encode global spatial coordinates of the pixels.

    This model supports the same type of conditioning as the base SongUNet, and
    can be in addition conditioned on the positional embeddings. Conditioning on
    the positional embeddings is performed with a channel-wise concatenation to
    the input image before the first layer of the U-Net. Multiple types of
    positional embeddings are supported. Positional embeddings are represented by
    a 2D grid of shape :math:`(C_{PE}, H, W)`, where :math:`H` and
    :math:`W` correspond to the ``img_resolution`` parameter.

    The following types of positional embeddings are
    supported:

    • learnable: uses a 2D grid of learnable parameters.

    • linear: uses a 2D rectilinear grid over the domain :math:`[-1, 1] \times
      [-1, 1]`.

    • sinusoidal: uses sinusoidal functions of the spatial coordinates, with
      possibly multiple frequency bands.

    • test: uses a 2D grid of integer indices, only used for testing.

    When the input image spatial resolution is smaller than the global
    positional embeddings, it is necessary to select a subset (or *patch*) of the embedding
    grid that correspond to the spatial locations of the input image pixels. The
    model provides two methods for selecting the subset of positional
    embeddings:

    1. Using a selector function. See :meth:`positional_embedding_selector` for
       details.

    2. Using global indices. See :meth:`positional_embedding_indexing` for
       details.

    If none of these are provided, the entire grid of positional embeddings is
    used and channel-wise concatenated to the input image.

    Most parameters are the same as in the parent class
    :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet`. Only the ones
    that differ are listed below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    img_resolution : Union[List[int, int], int]
        The resolution of the input/output image. Can be a single int for
        square images or a list :math:`[H, W]` for rectangular images.
        Used to set the resolution of the positional embedding grid. It must
        correspond to the spatial resolution of the *global* domain/image.
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels :math:`C_{in} + C_{PE}`, where :math:`C_{in}` is the
        number of channels in the image passed to the U-Net and :math:`C_{PE}`
        is the number of channels in the positional embedding grid.

        **Important:** in comparison to the base
        :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet`, this
        parameter should also include the number of channels in the positional
        embedding grid :math:`C_{PE}`.
    gridtype : Literal["sinusoidal", "learnable", "linear", "test"], optional, default="sinusoidal"
        Type of positional embedding to use. Controls how spatial pixels locations are encoded.
    N_grid_channels : int, optional, default=4
        Number of channels :math:`C_{PE}` in the positional embedding grid. For 'sinusoidal' must be 4 or
        multiple of 4. For 'linear' and 'test' must be 2. For 'learnable' can be any
        value. If 0, positional embedding is disabled (but ``lead_time_mode`` may still be used).
    lead_time_mode : bool, optional, default=False
        Provided for convenience. It is recommended to use the architecture

    Forward
    -------
    x : torch.Tensor
        The input image of shape :math:`(B, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`,
        where :math:`H_{in}` and :math:`W_{in}` are the spatial dimensions of
        the input image (does not need to be the full image).
        In general ``x`` is the channel-wise concatenation of the latent state :math:`\mathbf{x}` and
        additional images used for conditioning. For an unconditional model, ``x``
        is simply the latent state :math:`\mathbf{x}`.

        *Note:* :math:`H_{in}` and :math:`W_{in}` do not need to match the
        ``img_resolution`` parameter, except when ``additive_pos_embed`` is ``True``.
        In all other cases, the resolution of ``x`` must be smaller than
        ``img_resolution``.
    noise_labels : torch.Tensor
        The noise labels of shape :math:`(B,)`. Used for conditioning on
        the diffusion noise level.
    class_labels : torch.Tensor
        The class labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{label_dim})`. Used for
        conditioning on any vector-valued quantity. Can pass ``None`` when
        ``label_dim`` is 0.
    global_index : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The global indices of the positional embeddings to use. If neither
        ``global_index`` nor ``embedding_selector`` are provided, the entire
        positional embedding grid of shape :math:`(C_{PE}, H, W)` is used.
        In this case ``x`` must have the same spatial resolution as the positional
        embedding grid. See :meth:`positional_embedding_indexing` for details.
    embedding_selector : Callable, optional, default=None
        A function that selects the positional embeddings to use. See
        :meth:`positional_embedding_selector` for details.
    augment_labels : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The augmentation labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{augment_dim})`. Used
        for conditioning on any additional vector-valued quantity. Can pass
        ``None`` when ``augment_dim`` is 0.

    Outputs
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The output tensor of shape :math:`(B, C_{out}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.


    .. important::
        Unlike positional embeddings defined by ``embedding_type`` in the parent
        class :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet` that
        encode the diffusion time-step (or noise level), the positional embeddings in this
        specialized architecture encode global spatial coordinates of the
        pixels.

        r"""Select positional embeddings using global indices.

        This method uses global indices to select specific subset of the
        positional embedding grid and/or the lead-time embedding grid (called
        *patches*). If no indices are provided, the entire embedding grid is returned.
        The positional embedding grid is returned if ``N_grid_channels > 0``, while
        the lead-time embedding grid is returned if ``lead_time_mode == True``. If
        both positional and lead-time embedding are enabled, both are returned
        (concatenated). If neither is enabled, this function should not be called;
        doing so will raise a ValueError.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : torch.Tensor
            Input tensor of shape :math:`(P \times B, C, H_{in}, W_{in})`.
            Only used to determine batch size :math:`B` and device.
        global_index : Optional[torch.Tensor], default=None
            Tensor of shape :math:`(P, 2, H_{in}, W_{in})` that correspond to
            the patches to extract from the positional embedding grid.
            :math:`P` is the number of distinct patches in the input tensor ``x``.
            The channel dimension should contain :math:`j`, :math:`i` indices that
            should represent the indices of the pixels to extract from the
            embedding grid.
        lead_time_label : Optional[torch.Tensor], default=None
            Tensor of shape :math:`(B,)` that corresponds to the lead-time
            label for each batch element. Only used if ``lead_time_mode`` is True.

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            Selected embeddings with shape :math:`(P \times B, C_{PE} [+
            C_{LT}], H_{in}, W_{in})`. :math:`C_{PE}` is the number of
            embedding channels in the positional embedding grid, and
            :math:`C_{LT}` is the number of embedding channels in the lead-time
            embedding grid. If ``lead_time_label`` is provided, the lead-time
            embedding channels are included. If ``global_index`` is `None`,
            :math:`P = 1` is assumed, and the positional embedding grid is
            duplicated :math:`B` times and returned with shape
            :math:`(B, C_{PE} [+ C_{LT}], H, W)`.

        Example
        -------
        >>> # Create global indices using patching utility:
        >>> from physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion import GridPatching2D
        >>> patching = GridPatching2D(img_shape=(16, 16), patch_shape=(8, 8))
        >>> global_index = patching.global_index(batch_size=3)
        >>> print(global_index.shape)
        torch.Size([4, 2, 8, 8])

        Notes
        -----
            - This method is typically used in patch-based diffusion (or
              multi-diffusion), where a large input image is split into
              multiple patches. The batch dimension of the input tensor contains the patches.
              Patches are processed independently by the model, and the ``global_index`` parameter
              is used to select the grid of positional embeddings corresponding
              to each patch.
            - See this method from :class:`physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.BasePatching2D`
              for generating the ``global_index`` parameter:
              :meth:`~physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.BasePatching2D.global_index`.

        Similar to :meth:`positional_embedding_indexing`, but instead uses a selector
        function to select the embeddings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : torch.Tensor
            Input tensor of shape :math:`(P \times B, C, H_{in}, W_{in})`.
            Only used to determine the dtype.
        embedding_selector : Callable[[torch.Tensor], torch.Tensor]
            Function that takes as input the entire embedding grid of shape
            :math:`(C_{PE}, H, W)` (or :math:`(B, C_{LT}, H, W)`
            when ``lead_time_label`` is provided) and returns selected embeddings with shape
            :math:`(P \times B, C_{PE}, H_{in}, W_{in})` (or :math:`(P \times B, C_{LT}, H_{in}, W_{in})`
            when ``lead_time_label`` is provided).
            Each selected embedding should correspond to the portion of the embedding grid
            that corresponds to the batch element in ``x``.
            Typically this should be based on
            :meth:`physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.BasePatching2D.apply` method to
            maintain consistency with patch extraction.
        lead_time_label : Optional[torch.Tensor], default=None
            Tensor of shape :math:`(B,)` that corresponds to the lead-time
            label for each batch element. Only used if ``lead_time_mode`` is ``True``.

        Returns
        -------
        torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape :math:`(P \times B, C_{PE} [+ C_{LT}], H_{in}, W_{in})`.
            :math:`C_{PE}` is the number of embedding channels in the positional embedding grid,
            and :math:`C_{LT}` is the number of embedding channels in the lead-time embedding grid.
            If ``lead_time_label`` is provided, the lead-time embedding channels are included.

        Notes
        -----
            - This method is typically used in patch-based diffusion (or
              multi-diffusion), where a large input image is split into
              multiple patches. The batch dimension of the input tensor contains the patches.
              Patches are processed independently by the model, and the ``embedding_selector`` function is used
              to select the grid of positional embeddings corresponding to each
              patch.
            - See the method
              :meth:`~physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.BasePatching2D.apply` from
              :class:`physicsnemo.diffusion.multi_diffusion.BasePatching2D` for generating
              the ``embedding_selector`` parameter, as well as the example
              below.

class SongUNetPosLtEmbd(SongUNetPosEmbd):
    r"""
    This specialized architecture extends
    :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNetPosEmbd` with two
    additional capabilities:

    1. The model can be conditioned on lead-time labels. These labels encode
       *physical* time information, such as a forecasting horizon.

    2. Similarly to the parent ``SongUNetPosEmbd``, this model predicts
       regression targets, but it can also produce classification predictions.
       More precisely, some of the output channels are probability outputs, that
       are passed through a softmax activation function. This is useful for
       multi-task applications, where the objective is a combination of both
       regression and classification losses.

    The mechanism to condition on lead-time labels is implemented by:

    • First generating a grid of learnable lead-time embeddings of shape
      :math:`(\text{lead_time_steps}, C_{LT}, H, W)`. The spatial resolution of
      the lead-time embeddings is the same as the input/output image.

    • Then, given an input ``x``, select the lead-time embeddings that
      corresponds to the lead-times associated with the samples in the input
      ``x``.

    • Finally, concatenate channels-wise the selected lead-time embeddings and
      positional embeddings to the input ``x`` and pass them to the U-Net network.

    Most parameters are similar to the parent
    :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNetPosEmbd`, at the
    exception of the ones listed below.

    Parameters
    -----------
    in_channels : int
        Number of channels :math:`C_{in} + C_{PE} + C_{LT}` in the image passed to the U-Net.

        *Important:* in comparison to the base :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet`,
        this parameter should also include the number of channels in the positional embedding grid
        :math:`C_{PE}` and the number of channels in the lead-time embedding grid
        :math:`C_{LT}`.
    lead_time_channels : int, optional, default=None
        Number of channels :math:`C_{LT}` in the lead time embedding. These are
        learned embeddings that encode *physical* time information.
    lead_time_steps : int, optional, default=9
        Number of discrete lead time steps to support. Each step gets its own
        learned embedding vector of shape :math:`(C_{LT}, H, W)`.
    prob_channels : List[int], optional, default=[]
        Indices of channels that are probability outputs (or *classification* predictions),
        In training mode, the model outputs logits for these probability
        channels, and in eval mode, the model applies a softmax to outputs the probabilities.

    Forward
    -------
    x : torch.Tensor
        The input image of shape :math:`(B, C_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`,
        where :math:`H_{in}` and :math:`W_{in}` are the spatial dimensions of
        the input image (does not need to be the full image).
    noise_labels : torch.Tensor
        The noise labels of shape :math:`(B,)`. Used for conditioning on
        the diffusion noise level.
    class_labels : torch.Tensor
        The class labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{label_dim})`. Used for
        conditioning on any vector-valued quantity. Can pass ``None`` when
        ``label_dim`` is 0.
    global_index : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The global indices of the positional embeddings to use. See
        :meth:`positional_embedding_indexing` for details. If neither
        ``global_index`` nor ``embedding_selector`` are provided, the entire
        positional embedding grid is used.
    embedding_selector : Callable, optional, default=None
        A function that selects the positional embeddings to use. See
        :meth:`positional_embedding_selector` for details.
    augment_labels : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The augmentation labels of shape :math:`(B, \text{augment_dim})`. Used
        for conditioning on any additional vector-valued quantity.
    lead_time_label : torch.Tensor, optional, default=None
        The lead-time labels of shape :math:`(B,)`. Used for selecting
        lead-time embeddings. It should contain the indices of the lead-time
        embeddings that correspond to the lead-time of each sample in the batch.

    Outputs
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        The output tensor of shape :math:`(B, C_{out}, H_{in}, W_{in})`.

    Notes
    -----
        - The lead-time embeddings differ from the diffusion time embeddings used in
          :class:`~physicsnemo.models.diffusion_unets.SongUNet` class, as they do not
          encode diffusion time-step but *physical forecast time*.
