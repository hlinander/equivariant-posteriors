r"""Positional encoding components for FIGConvNet.

This module provides positional encoding implementations used to encode
spatial coordinates into high-dimensional feature representations.

The main classes are:

- :class:`SinusoidalEncoding`: Sinusoidal positional encoding using Fourier features
"""

# ruff: noqa: S101
import numpy as np
import torch
import torch.nn as nn


class SinusoidalEncoding(nn.Module):
    r"""Sinusoidal positional encoding using Fourier features.

    This module transforms input coordinates into a higher-dimensional space
    using sine and cosine functions at multiple frequencies. This encoding
    helps neural networks learn high-frequency patterns from low-dimensional
    spatial inputs.

    The encoding for a scalar input :math:`x` is computed as:

    .. math::

        \text{enc}(x) = [\cos(2\pi f_1 x), \sin(2\pi f_1 x), ...,
                         \cos(2\pi f_n x), \sin(2\pi f_n x)]

    where :math:`f_i = 2^i / \text{data\_range}` are the frequencies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_channels : int
        Total number of output channels. Must be even since each frequency
        contributes both sine and cosine components.
    data_range : float, optional, default=2.0
        Range of input data, used to normalize frequencies.

    Attributes
    ----------
    num_channels : int
        Number of output channels.
    data_range : float
        Data range for frequency normalization.

    Forward
    -------
    x : torch.Tensor
        Input tensor of any shape. The encoding is applied to the last
        dimension and expands it by ``num_channels``.

    Outputs
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Encoded tensor with shape ``(*x.shape, num_channels)`` flattened
        over the last two dimensions.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import torch
    >>> encoder = SinusoidalEncoding(num_channels=32, data_range=2.0)
    >>> x = torch.randn(4, 100, 3)  # (batch, points, xyz)
    >>> encoded = encoder(x)
    >>> encoded.shape
    torch.Size([4, 100, 96])

    Note
    ----
    The encoding is applied independently to each element along the last
    dimension of the input. For 3D coordinates, this results in
    ``3 * num_channels`` output features.
