class GridFeatureGroup:
    r"""Container for a set of factorized GridFeatures.

    This class represents a group of GridFeatures with different factorized
    representations (e.g., XY, XZ, YZ planes). Together, these factorized
    features can implicitly represent high-resolution 3D features.

    For example, with resolutions:
    - ``(high_res, high_res, low_res)`` for XY plane
    - ``(high_res, low_res, high_res)`` for XZ plane
    - ``(low_res, high_res, high_res)`` for YZ plane

    These can synthesize features at ``(high_res, high_res, high_res)`` through
    the :class:`GridFeatureGroupToPoint` module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_features : List[GridFeatures]
        List of GridFeatures objects, one for each factorized representation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    grid_features : List[GridFeatures]
        The stored list of GridFeatures.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from physicsnemo.models.figconvnet.geometries import GridFeatures
    >>> import torch
    >>> # Create three factorized grid features
    >>> gf1 = GridFeatures(torch.randn(2, 128, 128, 2, 3), torch.randn(2, 128, 128, 2, 32))

class GridFeaturesGroupIntraCommunication(nn.Module):
    r"""Inter-grid communication for GridFeatureGroup.

    This module enables communication between the factorized grid features in a
    GridFeatureGroup. The communication is achieved by sampling features from
    one grid at the vertex locations of another grid, effectively sharing
    information across the different factorized representations.

    Mathematically, for a set of grid features :math:`\mathcal{G} = \{G_1, G_2, ..., G_n\}`,
    the communication for each :math:`G_i` is computed as:

    .. math::

        G_i(v) = G_i(v) \circ \sum_{j \neq i} G_j(v)

    where :math:`v` are the vertices of :math:`G_i` and :math:`\circ` is either
    element-wise sum or multiplication depending on ``communication_type``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    communication_type : Literal["sum", "mul"], optional, default="sum"
        Type of communication operation. ``"sum"`` adds sampled features,
        ``"mul"`` multiplies them element-wise.

    Forward
    -------
    grid_features_group : GridFeatureGroup
        Input group of grid features.

    Outputs
    -------
