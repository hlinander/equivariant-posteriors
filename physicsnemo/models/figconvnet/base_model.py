class BaseModel(Module):
    r"""Base model class for FIGConvNet models.

    This abstract base class provides a common interface for all FIGConvNet-based
    models. It defines the standard methods that subclasses should implement for
    data conversion, loss computation, evaluation, and visualization.

    Subclasses must implement the abstract methods to provide model-specific
    functionality for training and inference pipelines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None
        This base class does not define constructor parameters. Subclasses
        should define their own parameters and call ``super().__init__()``.

    Forward
    -------
    This base class does not define a forward method. Subclasses must implement
    their own forward method with appropriate inputs and outputs.

    Outputs
    -------
    Subclass-dependent. See specific model implementations.

    Note
    ----
    This is an abstract base class. Do not instantiate directly.

        r"""Convert a data dictionary to model input format.

        This method transforms a dictionary of data (typically from a dataloader)
        into the appropriate input format expected by the model's forward method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_dict : Dict[str, Any]
            Dictionary containing input data from the dataloader. Expected keys
            and values depend on the specific model implementation.
        **kwargs : dict
            Additional keyword arguments for customizing the conversion.

        Returns
        -------
        Any
            Model input in the format expected by the forward method.
            The specific type depends on the model implementation.

        Raises
        ------

        This method computes all loss terms for the model given input data.
        The returned dictionary can contain multiple loss terms that will be
        combined during training.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data_dict : Dict[str, Any]
            Dictionary containing input data and ground truth labels.
        **kwargs : dict

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, torch.Tensor]
            Dictionary mapping loss names to their scalar tensor values.
            Common keys include ``"total_loss"``, ``"mse_loss"``, etc.

        Parameters
        ----------
