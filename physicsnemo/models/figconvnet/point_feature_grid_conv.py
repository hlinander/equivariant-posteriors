class GridFeatureConv2d(nn.Module):
    r"""2D convolution for factorized grid features.

    This module applies 2D convolution to factorized grid representations.
    It is equivalent to a 3D convolution with kernel size :math:`K \times K
    \times (2D + 1)`, where :math:`K` is the kernel size and :math:`D` is the
    size of the compressed (low resolution) dimension.

    This makes the convolution effectively global along the compressed dimension
    while being local along the high-resolution dimensions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_channels : int
        Number of input channels.
    out_channels : int
        Number of output channels.
    kernel_size : int
        Size of the convolutional kernel.
    compressed_spatial_dim : int, optional, default=1
        Size of the compressed spatial dimension. This is multiplied with
        the channel dimension in the factorized representation.
    stride : int, optional, default=1
        Stride of the convolution.
    up_stride : int, optional, default=None
        If provided, uses transposed convolution for upsampling with this stride.
    padding : int, optional, default=None
        Padding for the convolution. Defaults to ``(kernel_size - 1) // 2``.
    output_padding : int, optional, default=None
        Output padding for transposed convolution.
    bias : bool, optional, default=True
        Whether to include a bias term.

    Forward
    -------
    grid_features : GridFeatures
        Input grid features in a factorized memory format.

    Outputs
    -------
    GridFeatures
        Convolved grid features.

    Note
    ----
    The input must be in a factorized memory format (``b_zc_x_y``, ``b_xc_y_z``,
    or ``b_yc_x_z``), not in the standard 3D formats.

    a target format, enabling efficient transitions between factorized 2D
    representations and standard 3D representations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    memory_format : GridFeaturesMemoryFormat
        Target memory format.

    Forward
    -------
    grid_features : GridFeatures
        Input grid features in any memory format.

    Outputs
    -------
    GridFeatures
        Grid features converted to target format.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from physicsnemo.models.figconvnet.geometries import GridFeaturesMemoryFormat
    >>> converter = GridFeatureMemoryFormatConverter(GridFeaturesMemoryFormat.b_x_y_z_c)

        Parameters
        ----------
        grid_features : GridFeatures
            Input grid features.

        Returns
        -------
