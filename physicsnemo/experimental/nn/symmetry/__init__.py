"""Symmetry-equivariant neural network layers.

This module provides layers for building SO(2) and SO(3) equivariant neural networks
for processing spherical harmonic representations.

Classes
-------
SO2Convolution
    SO(2) equivariant convolution layer using grid layout for efficient processing.
GateActivation
    Gated activation applying SiLU to l=0 and learned gating to l>0.
EdgeRotation
    Apply Wigner D-matrix rotations to spherical harmonic embeddings.
    Use ``get_wigner_matrices()`` to compute and cache D-matrices, then
    call the module to apply rotations.
SO3ConvolutionBlock
    SO(3) block-wise transformation using SO3Linear -> GateActivation -> SO3Linear.
EquivariantRMSNorm
    RMS normalization for spherical harmonic features with global scaling.
EquivariantLayerNormTied
    LayerNorm for l=0, shared global scaling for l>0 with degree balancing.
EquivariantLayerNorm
    Per-degree normalization with independent scaling for each l.

Functions
---------
make_grid_mask
    Create a boolean mask for valid (l, m) pairs in the grid layout.
make_degree_balance_weight
    Create weights to balance contribution from each spherical harmonic degree.
make_m0_imag_mask
    Create mask that zeros out m=0 imaginary component.
