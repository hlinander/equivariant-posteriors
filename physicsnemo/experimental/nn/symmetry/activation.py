r"""Activation functions for SO(2)/SO(3) equivariant neural networks.

This module provides gated activations for equivariant features in grid layout.
The key insight is that scalar features (l=0) can have arbitrary pointwise
activations applied, while higher-order features (l>0) must be scaled by
invariant gates to preserve equivariance.

This implementation is thematically similar and takes inspirations from
the ``fairchem`` (MIT Licensed) repository, deviating in how data is
laid out and thus how computation is performed.

Classes

    Gated activation applying a nonlinearity to l=0 and learned gating to l>0.

class GateActivation(Module):
    r"""Gated activation for grid-layout equivariant features.

    Applies different activations based on spherical harmonic degree:
    - l=0 (scalars): Nonlinear activation
    - l>0 (vectors/tensors): Multiplication by learned gates passed through sigmoid

    This preserves SO(2) equivariance because:
    - l=0 features are invariant under rotation, so any pointwise activation preserves this
    - l>0 features are scaled by invariant scalars (gates), which commutes with rotation

    The gates are extracted from the input tensor itself, embedded in the channel
    dimension at the (l=0, m=0, real=0) position. This is the typical output format
    from ``SO2Convolution`` with ``produce_gates=True``, which produces both the
    main feature channels and additional gate channels in a single tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lmax : int
        Maximum spherical harmonic degree. Must be >= 1 (need at least one
        gated degree for this activation to be meaningful).
    mmax : int
        Maximum spherical harmonic order. Must satisfy 0 <= mmax <= lmax.
    channels : int
        Number of output feature channels (not including gates).

    Attributes
    ----------
    l0_mask : torch.Tensor
        Mask selecting l=0 positions. Shape: [lmax+1, 1, 1, 1].
    gate_indices : torch.Tensor
        Index mapping from l to gate index. Shape: [lmax+1].
    validity_mask : torch.Tensor
        Mask for valid (l, m) positions. Shape: [lmax+1, mmax+1].
    m0_imag_mask : torch.Tensor
        Mask zeroing m=0 imaginary component. Shape: [1, 1, mmax+1, 2, 1].

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Typical usage with SO2Convolution
    >>> # conv = SO2Convolution(in_channels=64, out_channels=64, lmax=4, mmax=2,
    >>> #                       produce_gates=True)
    >>> act = GateActivation(lmax=4, mmax=2, channels=64)
    >>>
    >>> # Input has embedded gates: 64 feature channels + 4*64 gate channels = 320
    >>> x = torch.randn(100, 5, 3, 2, 320)  # [batch, lmax+1, mmax+1, 2, channels_with_gates]
    >>> out = act(x)  # Output: [100, 5, 3, 2, 64] (gates consumed)
    >>> out.shape
    torch.Size([100, 5, 3, 2, 64])

    Notes
    -----
    Input tensor layout: [batch, lmax+1, mmax+1, 2, channels + gate_channels]
        - batch: number of samples/edges
        - lmax+1: degrees from l=0 to l=lmax
        - mmax+1: orders from m=0 to m=mmax
        - 2: real (index 0) and imaginary (index 1) components
        - channels + gate_channels: first ``channels`` are features,
          remaining ``lmax * channels`` are gates

    The gates are extracted from the (l=0, m=0, real=0) position in the input
    tensor. The first ``channels`` values at this position are the l=0 features,
    and the remaining ``lmax * channels`` values are the gates for l>0 degrees.

    Output tensor layout: [batch, lmax+1, mmax+1, 2, channels]
        - Same structure as input but without the gate channels
        - Gate channels are consumed during the activation, not passed through

    Forward
    -------
    x : Float[Tensor, "batch lmax_plus_1 mmax_plus_1 2 channels_with_gates"]
        Input features with shape [batch, lmax+1, mmax+1, 2, channels + gate_channels].
        The dimension of size 2 contains real (index 0) and imaginary
        (index 1) components. The last dimension contains both the feature
        channels (first ``channels`` values) and gate channels (remaining
        ``lmax * channels`` values).

    Outputs
    -------
    Float[Tensor, "batch lmax_plus_1 mmax_plus_1 2 channels"]
        Activated features with shape [batch, lmax+1, mmax+1, 2, channels].
        - l=0 positions have a nonlinearity applied
        - l>0 positions are scaled by sigmoid(gates)
        - Invalid (l,m) positions (where m > l) are zero
        - m=0 imaginary components are zero
        - Gate channels are consumed (not in output)
