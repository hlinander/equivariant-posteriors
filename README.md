# Equivariant posteriors
Train and evaluate PyTorch models with reproducibility in mind.

- Computational environment reproducible through Nix flake.
- Python based configuration in terms of dataclasses.
- Convenient metric functionality with focus on saving as much as possible for future inspection.
- Simple TUI for easy progress inspection.
- DuckDB-based storage with S3 ingestion pipeline for scalable run tracking and visualization.


## Quick Start with uv

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and run experiments directly:

```bash
# Run MNIST experiment
uv run python experiments/mnist/dense.py
```

On first run, `env.py` is auto-created with defaults. All data is stored under `.local/` (add to `.gitignore`).

### Local Ingestion

After training, ingest metrics into the central database for querying:

```bash
uv run python ingestion/ingest.py
```

Query results with DuckDB:

```python
import duckdb
conn = duckdb.connect(".local/analytics.db")
conn.execute("SELECT * FROM train_step_metric_float WHERE name = 'loss'").fetchdf()
```

## Nix
This project uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/) for reproducible compute environmens.

### Binary cache from [Cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)
We provide cached builds of dependencies for a CUDA enabled system through Cachix. See instructions at
[https://app.cachix.org/cache/equivariant-posteriors#pull](https://app.cachix.org/cache/equivariant-posteriors#pull).

It is probably also a good idea to enable the CUDA maintainers cache:
https://app.cachix.org/cache/cuda-maintainers#pull

### Install
Install nix to your home-folder or system wide.
```
  https://nixos.org/download.html#download-nix
```
Enable [flakes](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes) by one of

 1. Nix in other distribution: Create (or add to) `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` (or `/etc/nix/nix.conf`)
    ```
      experimental-features = nix-command flakes
    ```
 2. NixOS: Add to `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`
    ```
      nix = {
        package = pkgs.nixFlakes;
        extraOptions = ''
          experimental-features = nix-command flakes
        '';
      };
    ```


### Development 
Start a development shell
```
  nix develop
```

### Test project
To build and run tests
```
  nix build
```

### Build singularity image
Build a singularity image with CUDA support containing the project
```
  nix build .#sing
```
